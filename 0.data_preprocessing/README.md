#This folder contains the notebooks to preprocess and divide data for use with training and evaluation. 

This entire data pre-processing step (and the repo in general) will be dependent on a local pediatric_cancer_atlas_profiling repo (https://github.com/WayScience/pediatric_cancer_atlas_profiling) that is ran up to 2.feature_extraction. 

The config.yml file will need to be configured with the correct path to the pediatric_cancer_atlas_profiling repo for every notebook in this folder to work.
